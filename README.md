# CustomerProfileService

CustomerProfileService is a small service for managing customer profiles. It provides basic CRUD operations, validation, and persistence for customer data.

## Features
- Create, read, update, and delete customer profiles
- Input validation and basic error handling
- Simple persistence layer (configurable)

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Follow the project-specific setup steps (install dependencies, configure environment).
3. Run the service locally using your preferred method (e.g., `docker compose up`, `npm start`, or `python main.py`).

If you'd like, I can add a language-specific run example and dependency manifest—tell me which stack this project uses.
